# ProjectThotify

CS 554 Web Programming Course, This project takes in multiple techs in creating an application for people to meet other people with the same music taste.

Steps to run application:

Prerequisites:
Ensure that you have shared your spotify email address with us, so we can whitelist it. Our Spotify API is in development mode, so we need to whitelist emails.

Ensure that you have the env file in the server folder. We will attach the contents of the env file to the submission in case.

Now, to run the application.

1. run 'npm install' in all folders (chat-server, project-thotify, server)

2. 'npm start' in all parent folders (chat-server, project-thotify, server)

3. cd into server folder and run command 'npm run seed'

4. go to http://localhost:3000/, you should now be able to access the app.
